	Find the box you want.

	Then in command line go:

Grunt (grunt is similar to gulp - it is a task manager.)
To install grunt first we have to install node onto the server.
(While its installed on the computer, each virtual server you make will need to have it installed.)

In vagrant while its up

type: 

vagrant ssh

then: 

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash

then: nvm --version

and it should show the version.

then type: 

nvm install node

type: exit
(this will close the server which will reset and add node)

type: vagrant ssh
type: nvm install node

then cd to the directory the site is in eg. argo 

type: npm init

It will ask for a package name: type name of package.
version: press enter
descripttion: descrption of site
entry point: index.html
etc...
keywords: site keywords
author: jesse
licence: press enter
is this ok?: type yes

Now there should be a node_modlues folder inside of the project directory. From the npm website we can get the 
instructions to install things like jquer, sass gulp.
Once the package.JSON file is created any further librarys should be installed by typeing for example:

npm install bootstrap --save

(the --save will save it to the package.json file).

Note: 
So that git doesnt upload this file everytime, (because it may get large) you must create a file call .gitignore
and inside type node_modules and leave that file inside the project directory.

Note: npm update
will update any old versions of a package you might have, any old versions.
