<h2>table graph</h2>

	<p>What it does:<br>
	<br>A table can be sorted and paged.
	Tables make it easy to compare pairs of related values (e.g., quarterly sales over several years).<br>

	<br>Tables are not exclusively used to display quantitative information! Whenever you have more than 
	one set of values that have a direct relationship, you may use a table to organize the data. 
	For example, people often use tables to display meeting agendas with certain times, topics, locations, and speakers.<br>

	<br>The table is fairly complex because it can display quantitative values that are simultaneously 
	associated with multiple sets of categorical items.<br>
	<br>What its used for :<br>
	<br>Used when the data has precise values, when comparing individual values and when values invlove multiple units of measure.<br>
	<br>Example :<br></p>

<h2>Scatter Chart</h2>
	
	
	<p>What it does:<br>
	<br>Scatter charts plot points on a graph.<br>

	<br>Scatter plots are similar to line graphs in that they use horizontal and vertical axes to plot data points. 
	However, they have a very specific purpose. Scatter plots show how much one variable is affected by another. 
	The relationship between two variables is called their correlation .<br>

	<br>What its used for :<br>
	<br>Used when trying to view a relationship between two sets of data values.</p>

<h2>Stepped area chart</h2>
	
	<p>What it does:<br>
	<br>A step area chart is a special form of area chart which is useful for displaying changing numeric values 
	over a period of time. The (horizontal) x-axis in a step area chart represents a period of time, and 
	values are plotted on the (vertical) y-axis at constant or irregular time intervals.<br>

	<br>Step area charts are useful for plotting figures which change periodically or at unknown intervals, 
	such as bank balances or mortgage rates, crittic ratings.<br>

	<br>What its used for : <br>
	<br>Used when comparing multiple values and same source over each other.</p>
